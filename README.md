# August-2025-07th---cyber-d-fense-only-for-game-engines
Thé terme game engines must faill in physical ways. Lets use feynmann motivés. Adimensional modèles Can help us.
based on several cyber security projects here and especially on : https://github.com/neiji93/August-2025-06th---feynmann-motive-for-cybersecurity-toolbox-2025-2030-.git

workk still in charge with milis milic


release 1 dropped
Head body pattern 
Metadata pattern
All by intuition.
Thé game engine class Can bé Split intro 3 or 5 subvlasses because WE Can use 3 or 5 TEV in beam physics. Plus, thé subsystem IS clamped with 7  TeV. This means that WE cannot Access thé singleton. And this mean so that thé pattern requirements two éléments for calculuses on database datas. 
There IS nonsecure orocess here but it increase thé peed of nowadays calculuses of formal séries for thé physics engine itself. especially done for cpu registers. the architecture must accept foga design. so to have a mote secure physic engine, lets worry aboit cpu registers that enable low frequency voltage. the datas size are scaled.
nothing except foga algorithm is suited for yhose cpus here because nowadays formal series are also suited for a small bunch of codes 

as o said this first release is dropped now. lets ser you soon.
